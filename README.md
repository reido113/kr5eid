Kilowatt Reid's KR5EID Repository.

This Repo was created to hold the static website www.kr5eid.com using the GitHub Pages feature.

I will be experimenting a lot in this repo.

Why in the world it has taken me so long to narrow my static website hosting down to my github account - I may never fully understand. Regardless, I am here now and this seems to be a pretty darn cool way to proceed.

Plans are to redirect all of my personal domain name registrations and various collections on the internet into this repo.

Cheers
