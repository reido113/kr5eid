      <H1>Here is some Honest Radio Feedback</H1>
      <p>
        <h2>Connecting a cellular device to a radio network that is thousands of miles away is not all that amazing. Don't fool yourself.</h2>
        Ok, maybe try it for fun or even use it to pass traffic in an emergency, but to tie up some distant repater network with silly rag chew on a regular basis is just plain ASSeh9.<br>
        Stick to your silly social media accounts for this crap.<br>
        The only reason that I can see someone consistently tying up a distant repeater network by connecting with internet in the wee hours of the morning is because of Ignorance, Trolling, or Attention Seeking.<br>
        Ignorance meaning they choose to turn a blind eye to their annoyance.<br>
        Trolling means what is really being sought after is for someone to challenge you so that once could have something to whine and complain about.<br>
        In essence — an attention whore who lacks any real content and thus must try to bait others into combat. They thrive on this and at the same time are Ignorant to the fact that everyone really see right throught them.<br>
