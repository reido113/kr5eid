      <H1>Here Is Some Honest Radio Feedback<br>
      (that a lot of people seem to be afraid to say out loud)
      </H1>
      <p>
        <h2>Connecting an internet capeable device to a radio network that is thousands of miles away is not all that amazing. Don't fool yourself.</h2>
        Ok, maybe try it for fun or even use it to pass traffic in an emergency, but to tie up some distant repater network with silly rag chew on a regular basis is just plain ASSeh9<br>
        Stick to your silly social media accounts for this crap.<br>
        The only reason that I can see someone consistently tying up a distant repeater network by connecting with internet in the wee hours of the morning is because of Ignorance and/or Trolling.<br>
        Ignorance meaning they choose to turn a blind eye to their annoyance.<br>
        Trolling meaning that what is really being sought after is for someone to speak up and tell you how annoying and sensless you are so that one could have something to whine and complain about.<br>
        In essence — an attention whore who lacks any real content and thus must try to bait others into combat. They thrive on this and at the same time are Ignorant to the fact that everyone really finds them annoying.<br>
        If you are a said nimbisul, seriously stop and think for a second. If an entire coastline of radio operators are monitoring radios in the overnight hours it is most likely in case someone calls out with and emergency.<br>
        All that you are doing is forcing these dedicated individuals to turn off their radios because of your self centered nonsene and thus you are preventing the network of good intentioned individuals from being able to respond if an emergency were to occur.<br>
