      <H1>Here is some honest feedback</H1>
      <p>
        <h2>Connecting a cellular device to a radio network that is thousands of miles away is not all that amazing. Don't fool yourself.</h2>
        Ok, maybe try it for fun or even use it to pass traffic in an emergency, but to tie up some distant repater network with silly rag chew on a regular basis is just plain stupid.<br>
        The only reason that I can see someone consistently tying up a distant repeater network by connecting with internet in the wee hours of the morning is because they are either Ignorance or simply Trolling.<br>
        No doubt about it in my book. Just to be clear...<br>
        Ignorance means they are so self absorbed that they refuse to accept reality.<br>
        Trolling means that they are just a glutton for attention. In fact, your daily discussions most likely lack any substance, and what you need most is for someone to challenge you so that you have something to whine about.<br>
